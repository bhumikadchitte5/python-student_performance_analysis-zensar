# python-Student Performance Analysis
Hi, I'm Bhumika Dinesh Chitte, a Third-year student of Computer Engineering (BE) from Amrutvahini College of Engineering Sangamner, and this is my project on Student Performance Analysis.

This project is part of my academic work during ZENSAR training session in Computer Engineering (BE). The idea behind this project is to create a system that helps in managing student records, calculating GPAs, and analyzing performance based on grades.

# Project Description:

The Student Performance Analysis System is a Python-based backend project that provides a REST API to manage student grades, calculate GPA, generate grade distribution reports, and notify students of grade changes. The system interacts with a database to store and manage student records, course information, and grades.

# Key Features:

1)Python REST API: Developed a REST API using Python methods (do_GET, do_PUT, etc.) to fetch and update records from the database tables (students, courses, and grades).  
2)GPA Calculation: Created a Python method to calculate the GPA of students based on their grades.  
3)Grade Distribution Report: Developed a Python method to generate reports that show grade distribution across different courses.  
4)Grade Change Notification: Implemented a Python method to notify students via email when their grades are updated.

# Project Files:  
 1)GPA_Calculation.py: Contains the logic to calculate the GPA of a student based on their marks. 
 2)Grade_Distribution_Report.py: Generates grade distribution reports for all courses.  
 3)Grade_change_notify.py: Sends notifications to students when any grade updates are made.  
 4)Student_record.py: Fetches student records from the database using the student ID.  
 5)table_structure_creation.sql: SQL script for creating the required database tables (students, courses, grades). 
 6)data_insertion.sql: SQL script for inserting initial records into the database tables.
